# HeatShield_MATLAB

Modelling of heat distribution through a spacecraft heat shield during reentry.

This project automatically records external temperature changes from a series of .jpg files. Tile thickness optimisation is carried out to minimise material cost and weight while ensuring internal temperatures remain within safe levels. A GUI is added for ease of use and visualisation.

The attached report adds further detail to the scope and process as well as containing results and discussions
